## High Priority Features

### Feature 1: Active Section Highlighting

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Medium

#### Description
Automatically highlight the current section in the TOC as the user scrolls through the document. This provides visual feedback about the user's current location.

#### User Story
*As a user reading a long document, I want to see which section I'm currently viewing in the TOC, so I can easily track my position in the document.*

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Detect which header is currently in the viewport
2. Highlight the corresponding TOC item with visual distinction
3. Auto-scroll the TOC to keep the active item visible
4. Update highlighting in real-time as user scrolls
5. Clear highlighting when no section is in view

**Visual Design**:
- Active item should have:
  - Colored left border (3px, using VSCode theme accent color)
  - Slightly darker background
  - Bold font weight
  - Different text color (brighter/accent color)

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TOC highlights correct section as user scrolls
- [ ] Highlighting updates within 100ms of scroll
- [ ] Active item auto-scrolls into view in TOC
- [ ] Works with all heading levels (h1-h6)
- [ ] No performance degradation on long documents (100+ headings)
- [ ] Highlighting persists when clicking TOC links

#### Technical Considerations

**Implementation**:
- Use `IntersectionObserver` API for performance
- Track all headers with unique IDs
- Add/remove `.active` class on TOC items
- Implement debouncing to prevent excessive updates

**Files to Modify**:
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.js`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.js) - Add scroll observer logic
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.css`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.css) - Add `.active` styles

**Potential Issues**:
- Multiple headers in viewport (choose topmost)
- Performance with 200+ headers (throttle observer)
- Nested sections (highlight parent and child)

#### Localization
No new strings required.

---

### Feature 2: Better Visual Hierarchy

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: High
**Effort**: Low

#### Description
Improve the visual distinction between heading levels to make document structure immediately scannable.

#### User Story
*As a user browsing a document, I want to quickly understand the document structure by looking at the TOC, so I can find relevant sections faster.*

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Apply different font weights for different heading levels
2. Use color gradients for hierarchy (h1 darkest â†’ h6 lightest)
3. Adjust font sizes for better scanning
4. Maintain consistency with VSCode theme

**Visual Design**:
- **H1**: Bold (600), 1rem, theme foreground color
- **H2**: Semi-bold (500), 0.95rem, 90% opacity
- **H3**: Medium (400), 0.9rem, 80% opacity
- **H4-H6**: Regular (400), 0.85rem, 70% opacity

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clear visual distinction between all heading levels
- [ ] Font sizes remain readable (minimum 0.75rem)
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Hierarchy visible in both light and dark themes
- [ ] No text overflow or wrapping issues

#### Technical Considerations

**Implementation**:
- Add CSS classes for each heading level
- Use CSS custom properties for theme integration
- Tag TOC items with heading level during generation

**Files to Modify**:
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.css`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.css) - Add hierarchy styles
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.js`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.js) - Add level classes to TOC items

**Potential Issues**:
- Theme compatibility (test with multiple VSCode themes)
- Long headings with smaller fonts (ensure readability)

#### Localization
No new strings required.

### Feature 3: Improved Hover States

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

#### Description
Add clear, responsive hover feedback to improve interactivity and discoverability.

#### User Story
*As a user navigating the TOC, I want immediate visual feedback when hovering over items, so I know they're clickable and where my cursor is.*

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Show hover state on entire TOC item row (not just link)
2. Add subtle animation on hover
3. Increase visual contrast on hover
4. Maintain accessibility (focus states for keyboard navigation)

**Visual Design**:
- Background color change (subtle, theme-aware)
- Text color brightening
- Smooth transition (150ms)
- Optional: slight left padding increase

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hover state visible on all TOC items
- [ ] Hover covers full width of TOC item
- [ ] Smooth transition animation
- [ ] Cursor changes to pointer
- [ ] Focus state matches hover state for keyboard users
- [ ] Works with dark and light themes

#### Technical Considerations

**Implementation**:
- CSS `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes
- Use VSCode theme variables for colors
- Add `transition` property for smoothness

**Files to Modify**:
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.css`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.css) - Add hover styles

**Potential Issues**:
- Conflicting with active state (ensure active has higher priority)
- Touch devices (consider `:active` state)

#### Localization
No new strings required.

### Feature 4: Better Spacing

**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

#### Description

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Increase line-height for better readability
2. Add padding between major sections
3. Improve spacing around TOC header
4. Maintain compact layout (don't waste space)

**Visual Design**:
- Line height: 1.6 (currently ~1.2)
- Padding between top-level items: 8px
- Padding around "Table of Contents" header: 12px vertical
- Left padding for nested items: 16px per level

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Line height improves readability
- [ ] Clear separation between major sections
- [ ] No excessive whitespace (TOC fits reasonably)
- [ ] Nested items clearly indented
- [ ] Spacing consistent across all heading levels

#### Technical Considerations

**Implementation**:

- Test with documents of varying lengths

**Files to Modify**:
- [`src/md-toc-sidebar.css`](../src/md-toc-sidebar.css) - Update spacing

**Potential Issues**:
- Very long documents may require more scrolling
- Balance between comfort and information density

#### Localization
No new strings required.

### Feature 5: Smooth Scrolling

**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Effort**: Low

#### Description
Add smooth scroll animation when clicking TOC links for better UX and context.

#### User Story

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Animate scroll when TOC link is clicked
2. Scroll duration: 300-500ms
3. Account for any fixed headers

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Smooth scroll works on all TOC links
- [ ] Animation duration feels natural (not too fast/slow)
- [ ] User can interrupt scroll by scrolling manually

#### Requirements

**Functional Requirements**:
1. Add expand/collapse icons next to parent items
